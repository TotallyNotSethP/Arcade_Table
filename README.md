# My Arcade Table
## About
Hello! My name is Seth Peace! My dad and I decided to make a table that you can play games on. This is the software for that table. It's powered by Python and PyGame on a Raspberry Pi 3 B+.

So far, we have successfully made the following classes: `Joystick`, `Grid`, `Color`, and `Screen`. They're located in the `classes` folder. Run them and you can try a demo program showcasing the class! Also, we have a test game up and running! It's the `simple_game.py` file.
